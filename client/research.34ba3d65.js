Furthermore, we are interested in self-supervised learning to extract adequate features for WSI.\nWe are also studying a reliable medical classification model based on multimodal data (MRI, natural language, omics, etc.) by applying confidence estimation through Bayesian deep learning and interpretability using explainable AI techniques.\n"}];function y(e,a,t){const n=e.slice();return n[0]=a[t],n}function w(e){let a,t,p,v,b,y,w,k,I,W,x=e[0].name+"",S=e[0].description+"";return{c(){a=n("div"),t=n("h2"),p=i(x),v=s(),b=n("p"),y=i(S),w=s(),k=n("img"),W=s(),this.h()},l(e){a=r(e,"DIV",{});var n=l(a);t=r(n,"H2",{class:!0});var i=l(t);p=o(i,x),i.forEach(c),v=d(n),b=r(n,"P",{class:!0});var s=l(b);y=o(s,S),s.forEach(c),w=d(n),k=r(n,"IMG",{src:!0,alt:!0,class:!0}),W=d(n),n.forEach(c),this.h()},h(){h(t,"class","svelte-18ll25p"),h(b,"class","svelte-18ll25p"),m(k.src,I=e[0].image||"image/dummy_wide.svg")||h(k,"src",I),h(k,"alt","..."),h(k,"class","svelte-18ll25p")},m(e,n){g(e,a,n),u(a,t),u(t,p),u(a,v),u(a,b),u(b,y),u(a,w),u(a,k),u(a,W)},p:f,d(e){e&&c(a)}}}function k(e){let a,t,i,o=b,m=[];for(let a=0;a<o.length;a+=1)m[a]=w(y(e,o,a));return{c(){a=s(),t=n("main"),i=n("div");for(let e=0;e<m.length;e+=1)m[e].c();this.h()},l(e){p('[data-svelte="svelte-2sbtyy"]',document.head).forEach(c),a=d(e),t=r(e,"MAIN",{});var n=l(t);i=r(n,"DIV",{class:!0});var s=l(i);for(let e=0;e<m.length;e+=1)m[e].l(s);s.forEach(c),n.forEach(c),this.h()},h(){document.title="SIML - Research",h(i,"class","content svelte-18ll25p")},m(e,n){g(e,a,n),g(e,t,n),u(t,i);for(let e=0;e<m.length;e+=1)m[e].m(i,null)},p(e,[a]){if(0&a){let t;for(o=b,t=0;t<o.length;t+=1){const n=y(e,o,t);m[t]?m[t].p(n,a):(m[t]=w(n),m[t].c(),m[t].m(i,null))}for(;t<m.length;t+=1)m[t].d(1);m.length=o.length}},i:f,o:f,d(e){e&&c(a),e&&c(t),v(m,e)}}}class I extends e{constructor(e){super(),a(this,e,null,k,t,{})}}export{I as default};
